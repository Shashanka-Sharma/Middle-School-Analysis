# Middle-School-Analysis
Analyzed a dataset of 595 middle schools in order to determine whether or not certain characteristics matter more when trying to predict admission into New York's elite specialized high schools. Used primarily python libraries in order to do pca tests and hypothesis testing. All data came from the NYC Department of Education.
