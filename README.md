# Middle-School-Analysis
•	Analyzed a dataset of 595 middle schools provided by the NYC Department of Education to identify correlations between 17 school characteristics and determine whether certain traits influence the probability a student gets accepted into NYC’s specialized STEM high schools.
•	Employed dimensionality reduction using a PCA script to reduce the number of variables inputted into several regression models that aim to predict math/reading scores. The models were assessed based of the Pearson correlation coefficient calculated from the line of best fit. 
•	Discovered that qualitative factors such as student perception of their school depicted poor correlations to objective measures of performance. The most effective regression models were created using data regarding socioeconomic status, funding by the government, classroom structure and ethnicity of the student body.
